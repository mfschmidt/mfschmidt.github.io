I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in Columbia University's Psychiatry
department. I am doubly lucky to be working with the wonderful people in the
[Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology Division](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/research/research-areas/molecular-imaging-and-neuropathology)
at the New York State Psychiatric Institute.

I've published [some work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z31g-XQAAAAJ&hl=en), with more to come.

I rarely tweet, but follow other scientists and occasionally post a picture of cool fungi
as [@mightypile](https://twitter.com/mightypile).
