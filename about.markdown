I am lucky to be a husband to a lovely wife and a father to great kids. I'm doubly lucky
to be a postdoctoral fellow in Columbia University's Psychiatry department.
I am triply lucky to be working with the wonderful people in the
[Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology Division](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/research/research-areas/molecular-imaging-and-neuropathology)
at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. And on top of all that, I get to 
dig around in interesting data every day while learning more and more about
extracting important signals from them. On good days, I even get to read others' work
to add breadth and depth to my understanding of how brains work.

I've tried to be useful by publishing [some work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z31g-XQAAAAJ&hl=en),
with more to come.

I help where I can on [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/2195489/mightypile).

I rarely tweet, but mostly follow other scientists and keep up with new developments
as [@mightypile](https://twitter.com/mightypile).
