I am lucky to be a husband to a lovely wife and a father to great kids. I'm doubly lucky
to be a postdoctoral fellow at [Columbia University](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/).
I am triply lucky to be working with the wonderful people in the
[Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology Division](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/research/research-areas/molecular-imaging-and-neuropathology)
at the New York State Psychiatric Institute after learning from more wonderful people
at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. And on top of all that, I get to 
dig around in interesting data every day while learning more and more about
extracting important signals from them. Most days, I even get to read others' research
to add breadth and depth to my understanding of how brains work. My enormous gratitude goes
out to far too many people to name for their past, present, and future assistance.

I've tried to be useful by publishing [<i class="ai ai-google-scholar ai"></i> some work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z31g-XQAAAAJ&hl=en).
I help where I can on [<svg class="svg-icon"><use xlink:href="#stackexchange"></use></svg> StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/2195489/mightypile).
I share code I've written on [GitHub](https://github.com/mfschmidt).
I rarely tweet, but mostly follow other scientists and keep up with new developments
as [@mightypile](https://twitter.com/mightypile).
If any of this may be useful to you, I'd love to hear about it and help you use it.
